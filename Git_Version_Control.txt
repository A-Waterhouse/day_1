having many people on same software at same time can cause problems.
need system in place to keep record of how process has changed overtime
instead of using versions (v1/v1.1/v1.2 / v2.0 etc.)
git will handle version control for us, manages how changes are made to the code and tracks it 
changes can be observed throughout
code can be reverted back easily and mistakes can be found, revert back to point where it was working

each change is called a commit (a point in code where something has been changed)

repos are source of data which we want git to manage version control

-    git init        will initialse the folder

and will make it the git repository
a .git folder will be created on computer

-    git log         shows information about the repo 

each time a timline is created we can branch off and created onther point in history

-   git status       shows status of the files and folders

-   git add          adds file to the staging area

-   git commit -m"(message/information)"    commits file to branch with the message

git will let you know what has changed

q can be used to quit pages in terminal

commits should be writtern in imperative tense

create repo >>> make chages >>> stage them with git add command >>> commit them with git commit -m""

================
common pitfalls
================
if forgot to add messgae to commit will end up in vim terminal where you cant type, i key iwll let you go into insert mode
add changes to the top
esc exits insert mode
:w means write
:q means quit
:wq will write and quit in one go

installed ohmyzsh

=====================================================

made new repo on git website and used git clone and address to clone it to the local pc 

when changes are made onlocal machine changes dont get put to github after commit
the local changes do not get updated automatically 
local changes dont get sent untill told to 
in local we can add commit change files etc and when ready the changes can be sent off to git hub uding PUSH

========push=======

local main and origin main are different when edited onlocal machine
to sync them up they must be pushed to the origin

inviting people to repo is done on the github website
other person will clone the repo

when other person updatest the repo the changes must be pulled to local machine
